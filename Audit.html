      </td>
      <td id = "KahootEne">Kahoot is a very engaging app, it promotes learning through fun and competitive quizzes, as well as being used for surveys.
         it is very visually appealing, using a variety of colors such as, red, blue, yellow and green amongst others. 
        it has very iconic and upbeat music which would change to give its user's a sense of urgency when the time is running out and has a suspensefull ending animation to see who ends up 1st on the podium.
      It doesn't have much of a balence between challenge and reward since it mostly would rely on what the user knows about the topic of the quiz, but whoever gets the answer correct first is given more points than someone who answers second.

     </td>
      <td id = "QuizEne">Quizlet is very engaging with it's many ways for it's users to revise and is customisable. 
        Users can choose between three different ways of revision, practice, test or flashcards.
        The tests can be customisable, letting the user choose if they want to type things in or not, or if they want to match pictures to a word or not.
        There's also a memmory game the user can play, matches images to word or words to words, this mode also counts how long it takes the player to match them all, prompting them to get better to beat their score.
        It sticks with a very minimalistic look in terms of aesthetics, using mostly white and blue for its colors.
        It does have sound allowing the user to listen to words during test and on flashcards, 
        theres a little bit of animation for the flashcards, memmory game and when completing practice or a test.
        There isn't much challenge and reward involved with this app.

      </td>
      <td id = "CCEne">CodeCombat is very engaging through its RPG elements and stunning visuals, easily being one of the most visually appealing apps out of the three.
        This app helps the user learn Java and Python in bitesized pieces with each level having the user do a little bit of coding.
      There is a fair balence between challenege and reward with the user recieving new items they can equip to their player character.

    <td><strong>Progress tracking:</strong> How well does the app track the user's progress? 
      Does it provide feedback and recommendations to help users improve their performance? 
      Does it use data to personalize the learning experience?
    </td>
    <td id = "KahootPT">It does track the users progress during quizzes letting them know how many questions they got right, this also being beneficial for surveys. But despite that Kahoot doesn't provide any recommendations to improve their performance nor personalise their learning experience by gathering user's data. (3/10) </td>
    <td id = "QuizPT">Quizlet tracks the user's progress extremely well, giving them how many questions they got wrong at the end of the test, showing them the answers and giving them the percentage of how close they are to learning everything on the respective topic.
      It also allows the user to redo the questions they got wrong at the end of the test to help them learn the things they got incorrect.
      It doesn't use data to personalise the experience. (10/10) </td>
    <td id = "CCPT">CodeCombat does track the user's progress through little markers on a map to show what levels they've completed as well as what their level is.
      If the user gets the piece of code incorrect, it will provide feedback and the problem with the user's code and give them a solution to it that the user will then type in themselves.
      It doesn't use data to personalise the learning experience. (10/10)

    <td><strong>User experience:</strong> How user-friendly is the app?
       Is it easy to navigate and use?
       Does it have clear instructions and prompts?
       Does it have a well-designed interface?
      </td>
      <td id = "KahootUE">The app is really user-friendly and incredably easy to navigate and use, with the user only needing to enter a game pin to join the game.
        It's very clear with it's instructions and prompts.
        The interface is easy to understand due to it being very simplistic, the question and timer would be at the top of the screen while the user has four different buttons they can press that corrolates to one of four answers.

      </td>
      <td id = "QuizUE">The app is user friendly, 
        but now requires a subscription to allow the user to practice and do tests however much they want instead of limiting them to only being able to use those crucial learning features 3 times a day for test and practices, unless they pay. (4/10)</td>
      <td id = "CCUE">CodeCombat is very user-friendly, providing a drop-down menu of different functions they can use while coding also giving the user a small blurb of what to do in the levels.
        It only allows users to do five levels before a pop up appears asking the user to pay for a subscription.(6/10)
